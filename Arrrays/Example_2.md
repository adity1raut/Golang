# Voter Eligibility Checker in Go

This program checks how many people in a given list of ages are eligible to vote (age â‰¥ 18).

## Code

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func isVoted(nums []int) int {
    count := 0
    for _, age := range nums {
        if age >= 18 {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}

func main() {
    nums := []int{75, 25, 65, 12, 11, 45, 78, 90, 100, 50}
    candidate := isVoted(nums)
    fmt.Print("Checking if the candidate is eligible to vote...\n")
    fmt.Println("The candidate is eligible to vote:", candidate)
}
