Absolutely! Here's a brief theoretical explanation of each concurrency pattern name I listed:

---

### 1. Fan-Out

Multiple goroutines simultaneously receive tasks from a single input channel or source. This distributes workload across multiple workers, increasing concurrency and throughput.

---

### 2. Fan-In

Multiple goroutines send their results into a single channel, merging several streams of data into one. This pattern collects results or events into one place for further processing.

---

### 3. Worker Pool

A fixed number of worker goroutines receive jobs from a shared queue or channel and process them. It controls concurrency by limiting the number of active workers, which helps manage resource usage.

---

### 4. Pipeline

A series of stages connected by channels, where each stage processes data and passes it down the pipeline. It allows breaking down complex processing into independent steps that run concurrently.

---

### 5. Semaphore

A concurrency control mechanism to limit access to a resource or critical section. It restricts the number of goroutines running simultaneously, often implemented using buffered channels.

---

### 6. Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub)

A messaging pattern where senders (publishers) broadcast messages to multiple receivers (subscribers) without direct knowledge of each other. It decouples message producers and consumers, allowing scalable communication.

---

### 7. Broker Pattern

An intermediary component (broker) manages communication between multiple producers and consumers. It buffers, routes, and dispatches messages, often handling load balancing and message durability.

---

### 8. Future / Promise

An abstraction representing a value that may become available later, allowing goroutines to wait for the result asynchronously without blocking the whole program flow.

---

### 9. Reactor Pattern

An event-driven pattern where an event loop listens for events and dispatches them to appropriate handlers. It allows efficient handling of I/O without blocking by reacting to readiness notifications.

---

### 10. Load Balancer

Distributes incoming work or requests evenly across multiple workers or servers to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, and reduce response time.

---

### 11. Rate Limiter

Controls the rate of task execution or requests, preventing overwhelming resources by limiting how often operations can be performed within a time window.

---

### 12. Scheduler

Manages task execution order and timing, deciding when and how goroutines run to optimize resource usage and meet timing requirements.
