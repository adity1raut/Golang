## **Step 1: Basics of Go**  
- What is Go, why it is used (speed, concurrency, simplicity).  
- Install Go and set up `go run`, `go build`.  
- Your first program (`Hello, World`).  
- Syntax: variables, constants, data types.  
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical).  

---

## **Step 2: Control Structures**  
- `if`, `else`, `switch`.  
- Loops: `for` (with/without condition).  
- `break`, `continue`, `goto`.  

---

## **Step 3: Functions in Go**  
- Defining and calling functions.  
- Parameters and return values.  
- Multiple return values.  
- Variadic functions.  
- Anonymous functions, Closures.  

---

## **Step 4: Data Structures**  
- Arrays and slices.  
- Maps (key-value).  
- Structs (custom types).  
- Pointers.  

---

## **Step 5: Advanced Types & Concepts**  
- Methods on structs.  
- Interfaces (Duck typing in Go).  
- Type embedding and composition.  

---

## **Step 6: Concurrency (Big Power of Go)**  
- Goroutines.  
- Channels (unbuffered, buffered).  
- `select` statement.  
- WaitGroups, Mutex (sync package).  

---

## **Step 7: Error Handling**  
- Built-in `error` type.  
- Custom error handling.  
- `panic` and `recover`.  
- Error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`).  

---

## **Step 8: Modules & Packages**  
- Using `go mod init` and `go mod tidy`.  
- Importing and creating your own packages.  
- Standard library (fmt, io, os, net/http).  

---

## **Step 9: File Handling & I/O**  
- Read/Write files.  
- JSON encode/decode.  
- Working with environment variables.  

---

## **Step 10: Web Development with Go**  
- Building REST APIs with `net/http`.  
- Routing (mux, chi, gin frameworks).  
- Middleware.  
- Templates.  

---

## **Step 11: Testing in Go**  
- Unit tests with `testing` package.  
- Table-driven tests.  
- Benchmarks.  
- Mocks and stubs.  

---

## **Step 12: Advanced Topics**  
- Reflection.  
- Generics (Go 1.18+).  
- Context package (for API requests, goroutines).  
- Go routines best practices.  

---

## **Step 13: Project Building**  
- CLI apps.  
- Web apps (REST APIs, WebSockets).  
- Microservices.  
- Blockchain, Networking, etc.
